# TwitterAlt
Twitter/reddit alternative for jetBrains internship - using Angular

Features:
  -i had not fetched any data but made a simulation of few get requests where i tought it would be necesary (by making objects that would represent fetched data and commented get requests).
  -likeable content.
  -in home page posts display two most popular comments.
  -comments can be accessed trough opening the post by clicking on posts text or comment button.
  -replies can be accessed by opening comments and clicking on the reply button.

UI decisions:
  -I tried keeping ui simple and minimalistic while keeping most of the functionalities.
  -UI has minimal number of animations/transitions considering this app would be used on all kinds of low end computers, so performance was a higher priority.

Struggles:
  -Mostly color pallete and design. -i just kept it as simple as possible in the end
  -Scalability when it comes to html and css as well as naming css classes. -well i eventually got the slight hang of it but it still needs a lot of improvement and guidance
